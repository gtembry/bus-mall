As a marketing researcher (team), I'd want to investigate the daily commuter's wants/needs. I want to keep track of the images the user clicks on so that I can determine which items are the most popular.

As a developer, I want to create a list of images of each individual product bus mall is selling. From the list of images I want to build an app that displays 3 of those images randomly.

As a bus company, I want to make sure all my this my passengers are aware of this app.

As a consumer, I want an app that's easy to use. Has products that I may find useful, and may potentially want to buy.
